**No**, an organization using **EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)** does **not** need to use **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**.

## ✅ Explanation:

| Concept | Clarification                                                                                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EKS** | A managed Kubernetes service by AWS. You run containers using Kubernetes pods, deployments, services, etc. |
| **ECS** | A separate AWS-native container orchestration system (not based on Kubernetes).                            |

They are **two different ways** to run containers on AWS.

---

## 🔄 Can they coexist?

Yes — but **they are independent**:

* Some companies use **EKS** for Kubernetes-based apps.
* Others use **ECS** for simpler AWS-native workloads.
* Some larger enterprises **use both** (for migration, testing, or team-specific reasons).

## 🧠 Think of it like this:

| You can use... | Without using... |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| ✅ EKS only     | ❌ ECS            |
| ✅ ECS only     | ❌ EKS            |
| ✅ Both         | (if needed)      |
