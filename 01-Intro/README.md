## AWS Introduction

### Cloud
> The cloud is a vast online storage space where people and businesses store their files and applications, accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. The cloud also offers services, such as computing power, databases, networking, and software applications.

### Public and Private Cloud
> The key difference between a private cloud and a public cloud lies in who owns and manages the infrastructure and how it's accessed. A public cloud is a shared environment, accessible over the internet, and managed by a third-party provider, while a private cloud is dedicated to a single organization, either hosted on-premises or by a private cloud provider, and offers greater control and customization. 

> Private cloud it's me and my organization maintaining and managing that entire platform. when it comes to public cloud (AWS, Azure or GCP) they are managing the entire data centre and eco system and we can request resources from them. we have the complete control but they are the once creating for us.
