Here’s a **real-world step-by-step demo example for AWS Lambda** — super simple and practical:

---

## ✅ **Use Case Example**

> **Send a welcome email whenever a new user registers on a website.**

---

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Demo**

### **Step 1: Write the Lambda Code**

Example in **Node.js**:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const userEmail = event.email;
    
    console.log(`Send welcome email to: ${userEmail}`);
    
    // Simulate sending email (actual code would call SES or any email service)
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: `Welcome email sent to ${userEmail}`
    };
};
```

---

### **Step 2: Create Lambda Function on AWS**

1. Go to **AWS Console > Lambda**.
2. Click **Create Function**.
3. Choose:

   * **Author from scratch**
   * Runtime: **Node.js**
4. Name your function: `SendWelcomeEmail`
5. Paste the code into the editor.
6. Click **Deploy**.

---

### **Step 3: Test the Lambda Function**

1. In the Lambda console, click **Test**.
2. Add test event:

```json
{
  "email": "newuser@example.com"
}
```

3. Run the test — logs show:

> `"Send welcome email to: newuser@example.com"`

---

### **Step 4: Set up a Trigger (Optional)**

You can trigger Lambda via:

* **API Gateway**: Expose a REST API endpoint
* **S3**: Trigger when a file is uploaded
* **DynamoDB/Kinesis**: Stream triggers
* **EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)**: On schedule or event

For this example:

* Connect **API Gateway** to create an HTTP endpoint.
* When someone calls the API with user email, the Lambda runs and sends a welcome email.

---

## ✅ **Bonus: Real-World Expansion**

In production, instead of just logging, you'd:

* Integrate with **Amazon SES** (Simple Email Service) to actually send emails.
* Use environment variables for configurations.
* Add error handling and logging via **CloudWatch**.

## ✅ **Summary**

| Step       | What Happens                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1. Code    | Write a function (e.g. send email) |
| 2. Deploy  | Upload to AWS Lambda               |
| 3. Test    | Run with test data                 |
| 4. Trigger | Connect API Gateway / S3 / other   |
| 5. Monitor | Check logs in CloudWatch           |
