### AWS CloudWatch in Simple Terms:

**AWS CloudWatch** is like a **monitoring and alert system** for your AWS resources and applications.

### Simple Understanding:

| What It Does                     | Simple Example                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Monitors Metrics**             | It tracks your EC2 CPU usage, memory, disk space, etc.                         |
| **Collects Logs**                | It collects logs from applications or Lambda functions to help debug errors.   |
| **Creates Alarms**               | You can set an alarm if CPU > 80% â€” it alerts you via email/SMS.               |
| **Visualizes Data (Dashboards)** | You can create graphs & dashboards to visualize performance data in real-time. |
| **Automated Actions**            | It can automatically restart servers or scale resources when needed.           |

### Real-Life Analogy:

CloudWatch is like the **dashboard of a car**:

* **Speedometer = CPU usage**
* **Fuel gauge = Memory usage**
* **Warning lights = Alarms**
* **Service logs = Application logs**

When something goes wrong, it **alerts you**, and you can also **check the logs** to see what caused the problem.

### Common Use Cases:

* Monitor AWS Lambda, EC2, RDS, S3 usage.
* Track errors in application logs.
* Set alerts for abnormal usage.
* Visualize application health in real-time.
